                    Hi, my name is Jackson Neal. I am currently a Junior at Boise State University, pursuing a bachlors
                    degree in GIMM (Game, Interactive, Mobile and Media). I have been very passionate about making games
                    ever since I was little, and I've learned to make my passion a reality. I have been apart of many
                    great projects with peers in college, and working on personal projects as well. When it comes to new
                    ideas however, I am more than happy to try new things, and see where those new ideas will lead me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am looking to
                    pursue a carrer in Game Design, with an emphasis in Level Design, Puzzle Design, Problem Solving,
                    and Concept Art. This page is for employers to see what I have done over my years of professional
                    experience in college and ouside, and for you to get in concact me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have any questions you would like to ask me abou my experience as a Game Design student, or
                    about the GIMM program, my contact information is at the bottom of the page, and at the top of the
                    page. My socials and resume are open to all people to look at, and to see my skills. I hope that you
